This is a weather app made using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. I made it using Open Weather Api and inspired by some creators in Youtube.
This app allows you to see the weather details of a city including humidity and wind speed.
Thanks for Debug Deployment for giving me this idea to create this projects in the part of internship.
I had also included video in the background so that it will be more intresting to use.
Thankyou
